# Wine Quality Predictor with KNN Classification

## Description:
The Wine Quality Predictor is a classification model that utilizes a public repository of wine quality data, which includes factors related to wine's chemical composition, obtained from the UCI. The goal of this project is to train a KNN classification model to predict the quality of a wine solely based on its chemical composition.

## Method:

### Data Preprocessing:
- Importing the wine quality dataset
- Cleaning and wrangling the data
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing dataset

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Analyzing the relationship between various variables and wine quality
- Utilizing graphs and visualizations to identify significant factors affecting wine quality

### Feature Selection:
- Selecting relevant predictor variables for the KNN classification model

### Model Building:
- Implementing a KNN classification model using the tidymodels library
- Performing 5-fold cross-validation to optimize the value of k

### Model Evaluation:
- Assessing the true accuracy of the built model using the test dataset

## Guidance:
This project was developed under the guidance of Professor Trevor Campbell towards the completion of DSCI 100: Introduction to Data Science at the University of British Columbia.
